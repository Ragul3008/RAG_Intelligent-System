Unit 1: Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data. The system learns a mapping from inputs to outputs.

Unsupervised learning involves training models on data without labels. The system tries to find patterns or groupings within the data.

Reinforcement learning is a type of learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

Overfitting occurs when a model performs very well on training data but poorly on unseen data. It happens when the model memorizes the training data instead of learning general patterns.

Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and unseen data.

Evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of machine learning models. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error.

Feature engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new input features to improve model performance.
